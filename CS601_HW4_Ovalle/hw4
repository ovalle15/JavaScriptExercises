Validate both firstName and lastName to ensure:
i. a minimum length of two (2) characters
ii. that only alpha characters are used (A-Z and a-z)
b. Validate facilitator and constrain the possible valid values to
be those of the active facilitators for the course during this
semester. For example, if we have facilitators with the following first
names: “Laura”, “Fazil”, and “Harsh”, you would ensure that only
these values would pass validation
i. Laura OR Fazil OR Harsh
c. facilitator is a text input, don’t change this into a select or any
other type of input.
d. The form should not be permitted to submit unless all fields pass
validation.
